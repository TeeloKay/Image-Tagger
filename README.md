# Tagger

**Tagger** (name pending) is a lightweight image tagging and organizing tool built with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). It helps manage and search large local image collections using custom tags and utilities.


 ## Features

  	- Image file operations: renaming, moving, and deleting images

  	- drag & drop support: Import images from the file exploorer directoy with automatic renaming to avoid conflicts.
